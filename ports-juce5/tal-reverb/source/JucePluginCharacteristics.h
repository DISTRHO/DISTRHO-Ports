    configurations: either with 1 input and 1 output, or with 2 inputs and 2 outputs. If
    you used this in Pro-Tools, the plugin could be placed on a mono or stereo track.
    If the list was just {1, 1}, then Pro-Tools would only allow it to be used as a mono
    plugin.

    As soon as a plugin's prepareToPlay() method is called, you can find out the actual
