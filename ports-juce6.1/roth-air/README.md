# Roth-AIR
Roth-AIR is a mixing tool for easily adding airy, crispy presence to your audio.

This is achieved by a combination of multiband compression and gentle saturation of the highs. It enables for a stronger, more consistent presence of high frequency material and works particularly well with vocals, synths and strings.

The process is made easy by a simple user interface, automatic makeup gain and a combined function "AIR" knob.
